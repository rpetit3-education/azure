# Exam AZ-900 Prep

[Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/)

## Why become certified?

Other than to collect all the certs? Mostly to get a much better understanding of Microsoft Azure, to greatly benefit my
current role at WPHL. I think the AZ-900 cert is a great introduction to Micorsoft Azure, which I am not too familiar with.

## Module 1: Intoduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

Big picture view of Azure

What is Azure? Microsofts cloud infrastruture (e.g. AWS, GCP)
200+ products and services

What is cloud computing? All the hardware is somewhere else, pick and choose the services you need (e.g. compute power
and storage). Shrink and grow resources as needed

benefits? don't have to maintain hardware, its "pay as you go", lowers operating costs because you are essentially
"renting" while you need. Its "always" up

Is Azure right for me? Probably, but IT said its the only I can use ;)

Most start with "can I do this on Azure?" and try this on virtual machines (VM), but as time goes on they expand into
the other services provided by Azure

Azure Marketplace - ready to use apps on Azure (e.g. debian builds)
    *In the Azure Marketplace you can find, try, buy, and deploy the software and services you need to build new solutions
    and manage your cloud infrastructure. You can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and reliably, hosted in your
    own Azure environment.*

Behind the scenes
- virtualization via hypervisor
- fabric controllers manage servers
- Orchestrator sends requests to the fabric controllers
- API and Portal interact with the orchestrator

Tour of Azure
- compute services
    - VMs, containers and microservices
    - Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Batch <-- most likely to use
    - Azure Container Instances, Azure Functions <-- seem pretty interesting
- cloud storage
    - disks on VMs, or file shares and DBs
- networking
    - private connections, firewall ports, ddos protection
- app hosting
    - run web apps on managed platform
    - azure marketplace
- AI
    - machine learning, searching data
- IoT
    - sensors and device management
    - dashboards
- integration
    - logic apps and connections between systens
- security
    - Azure identity management controls access to Azure
